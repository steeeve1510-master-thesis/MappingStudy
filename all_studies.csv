The technique is analogous to structural code coverage techniques, but it operates in the semantic domain of program properties rather than the syntactic domain of program text.The operational difference technique automatically selects test cases; it assumes only the existence of a source of test cases. The technique dynamically generates operational abstractions (which describe observed behavior and are syntactically identical to formal specifications) from test suite executions. Test suites can be generated by adding cases until the operational abstraction stops changing. The resulting test suites are as small, and detect as many faults, as suites with 100% branch coverage, and are better at detecting certain common faults.This paper also presents the area and stacking techniques for comparing test suite generation strategies; these techniques avoid bias due to test suite size.",,,,,10.1109/icse.2003.1201188

To reduce the manual effort of testing aspects in AspectJ programs, we have developed a framework, called Aspectra, that automates generation of test inputs for testing aspectual behavior, i.e., the behavior implemented in pieces of advice or intertype methods defined in aspects. To test aspects, developers construct base classes into which the aspects are woven to form woven classes. Our approach leverages existing test-generation tools to generate test inputs for the woven classes; these test inputs indirectly exercise the aspects. To enable aspects to be exercised during test generation, Aspectra automatically synthesizes appropriate wrapper classes for woven classes. To assess the quality of the generated tests, Aspectra defines and measures aspectual branch coverage (branch coverage within aspects). To provide guidance for developers to improve test coverage, Aspectra also defines interaction coverage. We have developed tools for automating Aspectra's wrapper synthesis and coverage measurement, and applied them on testing 12 subjects taken from a variety of sources. Our experience has shown that Aspectra effectively provides tool supports in enabling existing test-generation tools to generate test inputs for improving aspectual branch coverage.",,"coverage criteria, coverage measurement, software testing, AspectJ, aspect-oriented programs, test generation, aspect-oriented software development",,,10.1145/1119655.1119681

Several works have presented methods that create efficient test-suites using model-checkers. Ease of use and complete automation are major advantages of such approaches. However, the use of a model-checker comes at the price of potential performance problems. If the model used for test-case generation is complex, then model-checker based approaches can be very slow, or even not applicable at all. In this paper, we identify that unnecessary, redundant calls to the model-checker are one of the causes of bad performance. To overcome this problem, we suggest the use of temporal logic rewriting techniques, which originate from runtime verification research. This achieves a significant increase in the performance, and improves the applicability of model-checker based test-case generation approaches in general. At the same time, the suggested techniques achieve a reduction of the resulting test-suite sizes without degradation of the fault sensitivity. This helps to reduce the costs of the test-case execution.",,"test-case generation with model-checkers, LTL rewriting, automated software testing",,,10.1145/1291535.1291542

We investigate this hypothesis by empirically studying the effect of program structure on MC/DC coverage.To perform this investigation, we use six realistic systems from the civil avionics domain and two toy examples. For each of these systems, we use two versions of their implementation-with and without expression folding (i.e., inlining). To assess the sensitivity of MC/DC to program structure, we first generate test suites that satisfy MC/DC over a non-inlined implementation. We then run the generated test suites over the inlined implementation and measure MC/DC achieved. For our realistic examples, the test suites yield an average reduction of 29.5% in MC/DC achieved over the inlined implementations at 5% statistical significance level.",,structural coverage metrics,,,10.1145/1368088.1368111

On the other hand, model checkers were not originally meant to be used this way but for formal verification, so using model checkers for testing is sometimes perceived as a ""hack"". Indeed, several drawbacks result from the use of model checkers for test case generation. If model checkers were designed or adapted to take into account the needs that result from the application to software testing, this could lead to significant improvements with regard to test suite quality and performance. In this paper we identify the drawbacks of current model checkers when used for testing. We illustrate techniques to overcome these problems, and show how they could be integrated into the model checking process. In essence, the described techniques can be seen as a general road map to turn model checkers into general purpose testing tools. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, current techniques for identifying web application interfaces can be incomplete or imprecise, which hinders the effectiveness of quality assurance techniques. To address these limitations, we present a new approach for identifying web application interfaces that is based on a specialized form of symbolic execution. In our empirical evaluation, we show that the set of interfaces identified by our approach is more accurate than those identified by other approaches. We also show that this increased accuracy leads to improvements in several important quality assurance techniques for web applications: test-input generation, penetration testing, and invocation verification.",,"interface identification, web application testing",,,10.1145/1572272.1572305

To produce them, should we rely on the programmers, on automatic tools, or some combination?Recent work, in particular the Daikon system, has shown that it is possible to infer some contracts automatically from program executions. The main incentive has been an assumption that most programmers are reluctant to invent the contracts themselves. The experience of contract-supporting languages, notably Eiffel, disproves that assumption: programmers will include contracts if given the right tools. That experience also shows, however, that the resulting contracts are generally partial and occasionally incorrect.Contract inference tools provide the opportunity for studying objectively the quality of programmer-written contracts, and for assessing the respective roles of humans and tools. Working on 25 classes taken from different sources such as widely-used standard libraries and code written by students, we applied Daikon to infer contracts and compared the results (totaling more than 19500 inferred assertion clauses) with the already present contracts.We found that a contract inference tool can be used to strengthen programmer-written contracts, but cannot infer all contracts that humans write. The tool generates around five times as many relevant assertion clauses as written by programmers; but it only finds around 60% of those originally written by programmers. Around a third of the generated assertions clauses are either incorrect or irrelevant. The study also uncovered interesting correlations between the quality of inferred contracts and some code metrics.",,"eiffel, dynamic contract inference",,,10.1145/1572272.1572284

We define a family of coverage metrics for concurrent program testing that are well-suited to saturation-based adequacy and present a study that explores their cost and effectiveness.

In a study involving 386 humans and 800 web application faults, we observe that an arbitrary human judgment of fault severity is unreliable. We thus present two models of fault severity that outperform individual humans in terms of correctly predicting the average consumer-perceived severity of web application faults. Our first model uses human annotations of fault surface features, and is 87% accurate at identifying low-priority, non-severe faults. We also present a fully automated conservative model that correctly identifies 55% of non-severe faults without missing any severe faults.

Testing and verification is a critical phase in the development of such software products. Objective: Generating test cases based on operational profiles and certifying declared operational reliability figure of the given software product is a well-established process for the sequential type of software. This paper proposes an adaptation of that process for a class of massively parallel software - large-scale task trees. Method: The proposed method uses statistical usage testing and operational reliability estimation based on operational profiles and novel test suite quality indicators, namely the percentage of different task trees and the percentage of different paths. Results: As an example, the proposed method is applied to operational reliability certification of a parallel software infrastructure named the TaskTreeExecutor. The paper proposes an algorithm for generating random task trees to enable that application. Test runs in the experiments involved hundreds and thousands of Win32/Linux threads thus demonstrating scalability of the proposed approach. For practitioners, the most useful result presented is the method for determining the number of task trees and the number of paths, which are needed to certify the given operational reliability of a software product. The practitioners may also use the proposed coverage metrics to measure the quality of automatically generated test suite. Conclusion: This paper provides a useful solution for the test case generation that enables the operational reliability certification process for a class of massively parallel software called the large-scale task trees.

This paper presents a novel technique that applies spectra-based localization in synergy with specification-based analysis to more accurately locate faults. Our insight is that unsatisfiability analysis of violated specifications, enabled by SAT technology, could be used to (1) compute unsatisfiable cores that contain likely faulty statements and (2) generate tests that help spectra-based localization. Our technique is iterative and driven by a feedback loop that enables more precise fault localization. SAT-TAR is a framework that embodies our technique for Java programs, including those with multiple faults.

A residual investigation is a dynamic check installed as a result of running a static analysis that reports a possible program error. The purpose is to observe conditions that indicate whether the statically predicted program fault is likely to be realizable and relevant. The key feature of a residual investigation is that it has to be much more precise (i.e., with fewer false warnings) than the static analysis alone, yet significantly more general (i.e., reporting more errors) than the dynamic tests in the program's test suite pertinent to the statically reported error. That is, good residual investigations encode dynamic conditions that, when taken in conjunction with the static error report, increase confidence in the existence of an error, as well as its severity, without needing to directly observe a fault resulting from the error.  We enhance the static analyzer FindBugs with several residual investigations, appropriately tuned to the static error patterns in FindBugs, and apply it to 7 large open-source systems and their native test suites. The result is an analysis with a low occurrence of false warnings (“false positives”) while reporting several actual errors that would not have been detected by mere execution of a program's test suite.",,,,,10.1145/2338965.2336789

Researchers frequently compare test suites by measuring their coverage. A coverage criterion C provides a set of test requirements and measures how many requirements a given suite satisfies. A suite that satisfies 100% of the (feasible) requirements is C-adequate.  Previous rigorous evaluations of coverage criteria mostly focused on such adequate test suites: given criteria C and C′, are C-adequate suites (on average) more effective than C′-adequate suites? However, in many realistic cases producing adequate suites is impractical or even impossible. We present the first extensive study that evaluates coverage criteria for the common case of non-adequate test suites: given criteria C and C′, which one is better to use to compare test suites? Namely, if suites T1, T2 . . . Tn have coverage values c1, c2 . . . cn for C and c′1, c′2 . . . c′n for C′, is it better to compare suites based on c1, c2 . . . cn or based on c′1, c′ 2 . . . c′n?

The first technique relies on the assumption that the mutation score is highly correlated with the suite's real fault detection rate, which is not well supported by the literature. The second technique relies only on the weaker assumption that the ""interesting"" mutants (i.e., the ones that indicate an inadequacy in the suite) are in the set of surviving mutants. Using the second technique also makes improving the suite straightforward. Unfortunately, mutation testing has a performance problem. At least part of the test suite must be run on every mutant, meaning mutation testing can be too slow for practical use. Previous work has addressed this by reducing the number of mutants to evaluate in various ways, including selecting a random subset of them. However, reducing the set of mutants by random reduction is suboptimal for developers using the second technique described above, since random reduction will eliminate many of the interesting mutants. We propose a new reduction method that supports the use of the second technique by reducing the set of mutants to those generated by altering files that have contained many faults in the past. We performed a pilot study that suggests that this reduction method preferentially chooses mutants that will survive mutation testing; that is, it preserves a greater number of interesting mutants than random reduction does.",,"Fault detection rate; Highly-correlated; Mutation score; Mutation testing; Performance problems; Quality metrices; Random subsets; Reduction method, Fault detection; Software testing, Software engineering",,,10.1145/2491411.2494586

It is based on the insertion of artificial faults in the system under test (SUT) by means of a set of mutation operators. Different operators can mutate each program statement in several ways, which may produce a huge number of mutants. This leads to very high costs for test case execution and result analysis. Several works have approached techniques for cost reduction in mutation testing, like (n)-order mutation where each mutant contains (n) artificial faults instead of one. There are two approaches to (n)-order mutation: increasing the effectiveness of mutation by searching for good (n)-order mutants, and decreasing the costs of mutation testing by reducing the mutants set through the combination of the first-order mutants into (n)-order mutants. This paper is focused on the second approach. However, this second use entails a risk: the possibility of leaving undiscovered faults in the SUT, which may distort the perception of the test suite quality.

However, the methodology is also very costly, as the test suite may have to be executed for each mutant. Selective mutation testing is a well-studied technique to reduce this cost by selecting a subset of all mutants, which would otherwise have to be considered in their entirety. Two common approaches are operator-based mutant selection, which only generates mutants using a subset of mutation operators, and random mutant selection, which selects a subset of mutants generated using all mutation operators. While each of the two approaches provides some reduction in the number of mutants to execute, applying either of the two to medium-sized, realworld programs can still generate a huge number of mutants, which makes their execution too expensive. This paper presents eight random sampling strategies defined on top of operatorbased mutant selection, and empirically validates that operatorbased selection and random selection can be applied in tandem to further reduce the cost of mutation testing. The experimental results show that even sampling only 5% of mutants generated by operator-based selection can still provide precise mutation testing results, while reducing the average mutation testing time to 6.54% (i.e., on average less than 5 minutes for this study).",,,,,10.1109/ASE.2013.6693070

Code coverage has limitations, however, and sometimes it overestimates the true quality of the tests. Some researchers have suggested that mutation analysis may provide a better indication of test quality, while some educators have experimented with simply running every student’s test suite against every other student’s program—an “all-pairs” strategy that gives a bit more insight into the quality of the tests. However, it is still unknown which one of these measures is more accurate, in terms of most closely predicting the true bug revealing capability of a given test suite.

In addition, most of the studies were done with adequate suites, which are are rare in practice, so the results may not generalize to typical test suites. We have extended these studies by evaluating the relationship between test suite size, coverage, and effectiveness for large Java programs. Our study is the largest to date in the literature: we generated 31,000 test suites for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. We measured the statement coverage, decision coverage, and modified condition coverage of these suites and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness. We found that there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. In addition, we found that stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite.

Because the set of faults in a program is usually unknowable, this definition is not useful to practitioners who are creating test suites, nor to researchers who are creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites. In place of real faults, testing research often uses mutants, which are artificial faults -- each one a simple syntactic variation -- that are systematically seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults. Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence to support the use of mutants as a replacement for real faults. This paper investigates whether mutants are indeed a valid substitute for real faults, i.e., whether a test suite’s ability to detect mutants is correlated with its ability to detect real faults that developers have fixed. Unlike prior studies, these investigations also explicitly consider the conflating effects of code coverage on the mutant detection rate. Our experiments used 357 real faults in 5 open-source applications that comprise a total of 321,000 lines of code. Furthermore, our experiments used both developer-written and automatically-generated test suites. The results show a statistically significant correlation between mutant detection and real fault detection, independently of code coverage.

Mutation analysis is hampered by inherent scalability problems — a test suite is executed for each of a large number of mutants. Despite numerous optimizations presented in the literature, this scalability issue remains, and this is one of the reasons why mutation analysis is hardly used in practice. Whereas most previous optimizations attempted to stati- cally reduce the number of executions or their computational overhead, this paper exploits information available only at run time to further reduce the number of executions. First, state infection conditions can reveal — with a single test execution of the unmutated program — which mutants would lead to a different state, thus avoiding unnecessary test executions. Second, determining whether an infected execution state propagates can further reduce the number of executions. Mutants that are embedded in compound expressions may infect the state locally without affecting the outcome of the compound expression. Third, those mutants that do infect the state can be partitioned based on the resulting infected state — if two mutants lead to the same infected state, only one needs to be executed as the result of the other can be inferred. We have implemented these optimizations in the Major mu- tation framework and empirically evaluated them on 14 open source programs. The optimizations reduced the mutation analysis time by 40% on average.",,"software testing, Mutation analysis, dynamic analysis",,,10.1145/2610384.2610388

To help reduce the cost, automated test generation tools can be used to assist and guide developers in creating test cases. Yet, the tests that automated tools produce range from simple skeletons to fully executable test suites, hence their complexity and quality vary. This paper compares the complexity and quality of test suites created by sophisticated automated test generation tools to that of developer-written test suites. The empirical study in this paper examines ten real-world programs with existing test suites and applies two state-of-the-art automated test generation tools. The study measures the resulting test suite quality in terms of code coverage and fault-finding capability. On average, manual tests covered 31.5% of the branches while the automated tools covered 31.8% of the branches. In terms of mutation score, the tests generated by automated tools had an average mutation score of 39.8% compared to the average mutation score of 42.1% for manually written tests. Even though automatically created tests often contain more lines of source code than those written by developers, this paper's empirical results reveal that test generation tools can provide value by creating high quality test suites while reducing the cost and effort needed for testing.",,Manuals;Complexity theory;Software;Testing;Writing;Standards;Java,,,10.1109/QSIC.2014.33

A residual investigation is a dynamic check installed as a result of running a static analysis that reports a possible program error. The purpose is to observe conditions that indicate whether the statically predicted program fault is likely to be realizable and relevant. The key feature of a residual investigation is that it has to be much more precise (i.e., with fewer false warnings) than the static analysis alone, yet significantly more general (i.e., reporting more errors) than the dynamic tests in the program's test suite that are pertinent to the statically reported error. That is, good residual investigations encode dynamic conditions that, when considered in conjunction with the static error report, increase confidence in the existence or severity of an error without needing to directly observe a fault resulting from the error.We enhance the static analyzer FindBugs with several residual investigations appropriately tuned to the static error patterns in FindBugs, and apply it to nine large open-source systems and their native test suites. The result is an analysis with a low occurrence of false warnings (false positives) while reporting several actual errors that would not have been detected by mere execution of a program's test suite.",,"False warnings, existing test cases, RFBI",,,10.1145/2656201

Typically, a test requirement is a structural program element, and the coverage metric value represents the percentage of elements covered by a test suite. Empirical studies show that existing criteria might characterize a test suite as highly adequate, while it does not actually reveal some of the existing defects. In other words, existing structural coverage criteria are not always sensitive to the presence of defects. This paper presents PBCOV, a Property-Based COVerage criterion, and empirically demonstrates its effectiveness. Given a program with properties therein, static analysis techniques, such as model checking, leverage formal properties to find defects. PBCOV is a dynamic analysis technique that also leverages properties and is characterized by the following: (a) It considers the state space of first-order logic properties as the test requirements to be covered; (b) it uses logic synthesis to compute the state space; and (c) it is practical, i.e., computable, because it considers an over-approximation of the reachable state space using a cut-based abstraction.We evaluated PBCOV using programs with test suites comprising passing and failing test cases. First, we computed metrics values for PBCOV and structural coverage using the full test suites. Second, in order to quantify the sensitivity of the metrics to the absence of failing test cases, we computed the values for all considered metrics using only the passing test cases. In most cases, the structural metrics exhibited little or no decrease in their values, while PBCOV showed a considerable decrease. This suggests that PBCOV is more sensitive to the absence of failing test cases, i.e., it is more effective at characterizing test suite adequacy to detect defects, and at revealing deficiencies in test suites. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"C (programming language); Computer circuits; Defects; Logic Synthesis; Model checking; State space methods; Static analysis; Structural analysis; Structural properties; Testing, Analysis techniques; Coverage criteria; Dynamic analysis techniques; First order logic; Property-based; Reachability analysis; Structural metrics; Structural programs, Software testing",,,10.1007/s11219-014-9237-3

Researchers frequently compare test suites by measuring their coverage. A coverage criterion C provides a set of test requirements and measures how many requirements a given suite satisfies. A suite that satisfies 100% of the feasible requirements is called C-adequate. Previous rigorous evaluations of coverage criteria mostly focused on such adequate test suites: given two criteria C and C′, are C-adequate suites on average more effective than C′-adequate suites? However, in many realistic cases, producing adequate suites is impractical or even impossible.This article presents the first extensive study that evaluates coverage criteria for the common case of non-adequate test suites: given two criteria C and C′, which one is better to use to compare test suites? Namely, if suites T1, T2,…,Tn have coverage values c1, c2,…,cn for C and c1′, c2′,…,cn′ for C′, is it better to compare suites based on c1, c2,…,cn or based on c1′, c2′,…,cn′? We evaluate a large set of plausible criteria, including basic criteria such as statement and branch coverage, as well as stronger criteria used in recent studies, including criteria based on program paths, equivalence classes of covered statements, and predicate states. The criteria are evaluated on a set of Java and C programs with both manually written and automatically generated test suites. The evaluation uses three correlation measures. Based on these experiments, two criteria perform best: branch coverage and an intraprocedural acyclic path coverage. We provide guidelines for testing researchers aiming to evaluate test suites using coverage criteria as well as for other researchers evaluating coverage criteria for research use.",,"non-adequate test suites, Coverage criteria",,,10.1145/2660767

If done wrongly, reuse potential is not leveraged optimally and structures between tests and reuse components will become unnecessarily complex. We present a method to support test engineers in extracting overlapping clones. Using grammar inference algorithms, we generate a refactoring proposal that demonstrates test engineers how overlapping clones can be extracted. Furthermore, we visualize the generated refactoring proposal to make it easily understandable for test engineers.

This paper evaluates checked coverage, an alternative measure of test thoroughness aimed at overcoming this limitation, along with object branch coverage, a structure code coverage metric that has received little discussion in educational assessment. Checked coverage works backwards from behavioral assertions in test cases, measuring the dynamic slice of the executed code that actually influences the outcome of each assertion. Object branch coverage (OBC) is a stronger coverage criterion similar to weak variants of modified condition/decision coverage. We experimentally compare checked coverage and OBC against statement coverage, branch coverage, mutation analysis, and all-pairs testing to evaluate which is the best predictor of how likely a test suite is to detect naturally occurring defects. While checked coverage outperformed other coverage measures in our experiment, followed closely by OBC, both were only weakly correlated with a test suite's ability to detect naturally occurring defects produced by students in the final versions of their programs. Still, OBC appears to be an improved and practical alternative to existing statement and branch coverage measures, while achieving nearly the same benefits as checked coverage.",,"checked coverage, statement coverage, branch coverage, software testing, mutation testing, automated grading, programming assignments, automated assessment, modified condition/decision coverage, test quality, test metrics, test coverage",,,10.1145/2676723.2677300

By evaluating patches using tests independent from those used during repair, we find that the tools are unlikely to improve the proportion of independent tests passed, and that the quality of the patches is proportional to the coverage of the test suite used during repair. For programs that pass most tests, the tools are as likely to break tests as to fix them. However, novice developers also overfit, and automated repair performs no worse than these developers.

Test the least-Tested code, and stop when all code is well-Tested, is a reasonable answer. Many measures of ""testedness"" have been proposed; unfortunately, we do not know whether these are truly effective. In this paper we propose a novel evaluation of two of the most important and widely-used measures of test suite qual-ity. The first measure is statement coverage, the simplest and best-known code coverage measure. The second mea-sure is mutation score, a supposedly more powerful, though expensive, measure. We evaluate these measures using the actual criteria of interest: if a program element is (by these measures) well tested at a given point in time, it should require fewer fu-ture bug-fixes than a ""poorly tested"" element. If not, then it seems likely that we are not effectively measuring tested-ness. Using a large number of open source Java programs from Github and Apache, we show that both statement cov-erage and mutation score have only a weak negative corre-lation with bug-fixes. Despite the lack of strong correlation, there are statistically and practically significant differences between program elements for various binary criteria. Pro-gram elements (other than classes) covered by any test case see about half as many bug-fixes as those not covered, and a similar line can be drawn for mutation score thresholds.

However, whether a mutant is equivalent to the original program is undecidable in general. Thus, even when improving a test suite, a mutant score assessing this test suite may become worse during the development of a system, because of equivalent mutants introduced during mutant creation. This is a fundamental problem. Using static analysis and symbolic execution, we show how to establish non-equivalence or ""don't know"" among mutants. If the number of don't knows is small, this is a good indicator that a computed mutation score actually reflects its above definition. We can therefore have an increased confidence that mutation score trends correspond to actual improvements of a test suite's quality, and are not overly polluted by equivalent mutants. Using a set of 14 representative unit size programs, we show that for some, but not all, of these programs, the above confidence can indeed be established. We also evaluate the reproducibility, efficiency and effectiveness of our Nequivack tool. Our findings are that reproducibility is completely given. A single mutant analysis can be performed within 3 seconds on average, which is efficient for practical and industrial applications. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Static analysis; Verification, Equivalence checking; Equivalent Mutants; mutant score confidence; Mutation score; Reproducibilities; Single mutant; Symbolic execution, Software testing",,,10.1109/ICSTW.2016.29

For completeness the choices correspond to permitted input values as well as some values to account for boundaries or robustness. These choices are then combined to form test frames on the basis of various criteria such as each choice or pairwise. To ensure that the combinations of choices are feasible and account for valid sets of user requirements, constraints are introduced to specify permitted combinations among choices, and to specify single or error choices.

The main reason for the high computational cost is that many of the mutants are redundant and thus, do not contribute to the quality of the test suite. One of the most promising approaches to avoid producing redundant mutants is to identify subsumption relations among mutants, preferably before these are generated. Such relations have for example, been identified at an operator level for mutants created by the ROR operator. This reduced set of non-redundant mutants has been used in several recent studies and is also the default option in at least one mutation testing tool that supports strong mutation. This raises questions on whether the identified subsumption relations between the mutants hold in a context of strong mutation or variants of weak mutation that require some limited error propagation (firm mutation). We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the subsumption relations in the context of strong or firm mutation. We observed that it is possible to create a test suite that is 100% adequate for the reduced set of mutants while not being 100% adequate for the complete set. This shows that the subsumption relations do not hold for strong or firm mutation. We provide several examples on this behavior and discuss the root causes. Our findings are important since strong and firm mutation both are frequently used to evaluate test suites and testing criteria. The choice of whether to use a reduced set of mutants or an entire set should however, not be made without consideration of the context in which they are used (i.e., strong, firm or weak mutation) since the subsumption relations between ROR mutants do not hold for strong or firm mutation. Just as redundant mutants can give an overestimation of the mutation score for a test suite, using the reduced set of mutants can give an underestimation if used together with strong or firm mutation. Results reported from such studies should therefore, be accompanied by information on whether the reduced or complete set of mutants was used and if the researchers used strong, firm or weak mutation.",,Context;Software;Conferences;Software testing;Informatics;Computational efficiency;mutation testing;redundant mutant;strong mutation;subsumption,,,10.1109/ICSTW.2016.28

Thus, if automatic test data generation can achieve an acceptable level of mutation score, it has the potential to greatly reduce the involved manual effort. This paper proposes an automated test generation approach, using hill climbing, for strong mutation. It incremental aims at strongly killing mutants, by focusing on mutants' propagation, i.e., how to kill mutants that are weakly killed but not strongly. Furthermore, the paper reports empirical results regarding the cost and effectiveness of the proposed approach on a set of 18 C programs.

Method: We have conducted a two-day workshop with our industry partners to come up with a list of relevant principles and best practices expected to result in high quality tests. We then utilised our academic and industrial training materials together with recommendations in practitioner oriented testing books to refine the list. We surveyed existing literature for potential metrics to quantify identified principles. Results: We have identified a list of 15 testing principles to capture the essence of testing goals and best practices from quality perspective. Eight principles do not map toexisting test smells and we propose metrics for six of those. Further, we have identified additional potential metrics for the seven principles that partially map to test smells.

To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we present a concrete instantiation: rather than executing tests against each mutant on the exact program version, ApproxiMut obtains an approximate test/program version by applying approximate transformations and runs tests against each mutant on the approximated version. Our initial goal is to (1) measure the correlation between mutation scores on the exact and approximate program versions, (2) evaluate the relation among mutation operators and approximate transformations, (3) discover the best way to approximate a test and a program, and (4) evaluate the benefits of ApproxiMut.

Mutation analysis tools vary based on language, when mutants are generated (phase of compilation), and target audience. Mutation tools rarely implement the complete set of operators proposed in the literature and mostly implement at least a few domain-specific mutation operators. Thus different tools may not always agree on the mutant kills of a test suite. Few criteria exist to guide a practitioner in choosing the right tool for either evaluating effectiveness of a test suite or for comparing different testing techniques. We investigate an ensemble of measures for evaluating efficacy of mutants produced by different tools. These include the traditional difficulty of detection, strength of minimal sets, and the diversity of mutants, as well as the information carried by the mutants produced. We find that mutation tools rarely agree. The disagreement between scores can be large, and the variation due to characteristics of the project—even after accounting for difference due to test suites—is a significant factor. However, the mean difference between tools is very small, indicating that no single tool consistently skews mutation scores high or low for all projects. These results suggest that experiments yielding small differences in mutation score, especially using a single tool, or a small number of projects may not be reliable.

Given our findings with respect to absolute limits, one may ask: How effective are the extant mutation reduction strategies? We evaluate the effectiveness of multiple mutation reduction strategies in comparison to random sampling. We find that none of the mutation reduction strategies evaluated - many forms of operator selection, and stratified sampling (on operators or program elements) - produced an effectiveness advantage larger than 5% in comparison with random sampling. Given the poor performance of mutation selection strategies - they may have a negligible advantage at best, and often perform worse than random sampling - we caution practicing testers against applying mutation reduction strategies without adequate justification. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",,"Software testing, Multiple mutations; Mutation analysis; Open source projects; Operator selections; Poor performance; Program elements; Reduction strategy; Stratified sampling, Quality control",,,10.1109/TR.2017.2705662

This paper addresses the questions of to what extent tests represent how real users use software, and how to measure behavioral differences between test and field executions. We study four real-world systems, one used by endusers and three used by other (client) software, and compare test suites written by the systems' developers to field executions using four models of behavior: statement coverage, method coverage, mutation score, and a temporal-invariant-based model we developed. We find that developer-written test suites fail to accurately represent field executions: the tests, on average, miss 6.2% of the statements and 7.7% of the methods exercised in the field, the behavior exercised only in the field kills an extra 8.6% of the mutants, finally, the tests miss 52.6% of the behavioral invariants that occur in the field. In addition, augmenting the in-house test suites with automatically-generated tests by a tool targeting high code coverage only marginally improves the tests' behavioral representativeness. These differences between field and test executions - and in particular the finer-grained and more sophisticated ones that we measured using our invariantbased model - can provide insight for developers and suggest a better method for measuring test suite quality. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Online systems; Testing; Verification, Automatically generated; Field data; Model inference; Real-world system; Software Quality; Statement coverage; Temporal invariants; Test execution, Software testing",,,10.1109/ICST.2017.36

We look at coverage from an operational perspective. We evaluate test suite quality by comparing runs executed during testing with runs executed in production. Branch frequency spectra are employed to capture the behavior during runtime. Differences in the branch frequency spectra between field executions and testing runs indicate test suite deficiencies.

Still, these links perhaps cannot be inferred unambiguously from the test and production code. We developed a method that is based on the computation of traceability links for different aspects and report Structural Unit Test Smells where the traceability links for the different aspects do not match.

Mutation testing tools usually target only one programming language and rely on parsing a program to generate mutants, or operate not at the source level but on compiled bytecode. Unfortunately, developing a robust mutation testing tool for a new language in this paradigm is a difficult and time-consuming undertaking. Moreover, bytecode/intermediate language mutants are difficult for programmers to read and understand. This paper presents a simple tool, called universalmutator, based on regular-expression-defined transformations of source code. The primary drawback of such an approach is that our tool can generate invalid mutants that do not compile, and sometimes fails to generate mutants that a parser-based tool would have produced. Additionally, it is incompatible with some approaches to improving the efficiency of mutation testing. However, the regexp-based approach provides multiple compensating advantages. First, our tool is easy to adapt to new languages; e.g., we present here the first mutation tool for Apple's Swift programming language. Second, the method makes handling multi-language programs and systems simple, because the same tool can support every language.

It presents software languages primarily from a software engineering perspective, i.e., it addresses how to parse, analyze, transform, generate, format, and otherwise process software artifacts in different software languages, as they appear in software development. To this end, it covers a wide range of software languages - most notably programming languages, domain-specific languages, modeling languages, exchange formats, and specifically also language definition languages. Further, different languages are leveraged to illustrate software language engineering concepts and techniques. The functional programming language Haskell dominates the book, while the mainstream programming languages Python and Java are additionally used for illustration. By doing this, the book collects and organizes scattered knowledge from software language engineering, focusing on application areas such as software analysis (software reverse engineering), software transformation (software re-engineering), software composition (modularity), and domain-specific languages. It is designed as a textbook for independent study as well as for bachelor's (advanced level) or master's university courses in Computer Science. An additional website provides complementary material, for example, lecture slides and videos. This book is a valuable resource for anyone wanting to understand the fundamental concepts and important engineering principles underlying software languages, allowing them to acquire much of the operational intelligence needed for dealing with software languages in software development practice.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify state-of-the-art TSR approaches categories, assess the quality of experiments reported on this subject, and provide a set of guidelines for conducting future experiments in this area of research. After applying a two-facet study selection procedure, we finalized 113 most relevant studies from an initial pool of 4230 papers published in the field of TSR between 1993 and 2016.

It is noted that majority of the experiments in TSR do not follow any specific guidelines for planning, conducting, and reporting the experiments, which may pose validity threats related to their results. Thus, we recommend conducting experiments that are better designed for the future.

Lack of ability and skills of developers to produce sufficiently good test cases are also reported as limitations of applying test-driven development in industrial practice. Objective: We investigate the impact of test-driven development on the effectiveness of unit test cases compared to an incremental test last development in an industrial context. Method: We conducted an experiment in an industrial setting with 24 professionals. Professionals followed the two development approaches to implement the tasks. We measure unit test effectiveness in terms of mutation score. We also measure branch and method coverage of test suites to compare our results with the literature. Results: In terms of mutation score, we have found that the test cases written for a test-driven development task have a higher defect detection ability than test cases written for an incremental test-last development task. Subjects wrote test cases that cover more branches on a test-driven development task compared to the other task. However, test cases written for an incremental test-last development task cover more methods than those written for the second task. Conclusion: Our findings are different from previous studies conducted at academic settings. Professionals were able to perform more effective unit testing with test-driven development.

Given a bug-triggering test program for a compiler, hundreds of compiler files are usually involved during compilation, and thus are suspect buggy files. Although there are lots of automated bug isolation techniques, they are not applicable to compilers due to the scalability or effectiveness problem. To solve this problem, in this paper, we transform the compiler bug isolation problem into a search problem, i.e., searching for a set of effective witness test programs that are able to eliminate innocent compiler files from suspects. Based on this intuition, we propose an automated compiler bug isolation technique, DiWi, which (1) proposes a heuristic-based search strategy to generate such a set of effective witness test programs via applying our designed witnessing mutation rules to the given failing test program, and (2) compares their coverage to isolate bugs following the practice of spectrum-based bug isolation. The experimental results on 90 real bugs from popular GCC and LLVM compilers show that DiWi effectively isolates 66.67%/78.89% bugs within Top-10/Top-20 compiler files, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug isolation techniques.",,"Compiler Debugging, Bug Isolation, Test Program Generation",,,10.1145/3338906.3338957

Furthermore, previous works have already demonstrated that fully automatic test-to-code traceability recovery for unit tests is virtually impossible in a general case. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for this task, which is based on computing traceability links using static and dynamic approaches, comparing their results and presenting the discrepancies to the user, who will determine the final traceability links based on the differences and contextual information. We define a set of discrepancy patterns, which can help the user in this task. Additional outcomes of analyzing the discrepancies are structural unit testing issues and related refactoring suggestions. For the static test-to-code traceability, we rely on the physical code structure, while for the dynamic, we use code coverage information.

While previous work shows that field-exhaustive suites can be automatically generated, the generation technique required a formal specification of the inputs that can be subject to SAT-based analysis. Moreover, the restriction of producing all feasible values for inputs' fields makes test generation costly. In this paper, we deal with field coverage as testing criteria that measure the quality of a test suite in terms of coverage and mutation score, by examining to what extent the values of inputs' fields are covered. In particular, we consider field coverage in combination with test generation based on symbolic execution to produce underapproximations of field-exhaustive suites, using the Symbolic Pathfinder tool. To underapproximate these suites we use tranScoping, a technique that estimates characteristics of yet to be run analyses for large scopes, based on data obtained from analyses performed in small scopes. This provides us with a suitable condition to prematurely stop the symbolic execution. As we show, tranScoping different metrics regarding field coverage allows us to produce significantly smaller suites using a fraction of the generation time.

Testing the relational database schema, which protects the integrity of this data, is of paramount importance. Mutation analysis is a means of estimating the fault-finding strength of a test suite. As with program mutation, however, relational database schema mutation results in many ineffective mutants that both degrade test suite quality estimates and make mutation analysis more time consuming. This paper presents a taxonomy of ineffective mutants for relational database schemas, summarizing the root causes of ineffectiveness with a series of key patterns evident in database schemas. On the basis of these, we introduce algorithms that automatically detect and remove ineffective mutants. In an experimental study involving the mutation analysis of 34 schemas used with three popular relational database management systems-HyperSQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite-the results show that our algorithms can identify and discard large numbers of ineffective mutants that can account for up to 24 percent of mutants, leading to a change in mutation score for 33 out of 34 schemas. The tests for seven schemas were found to achieve 100 percent scores, indicating that they were capable of detecting and killing all non-equivalent mutants. The results also reveal that the execution cost of mutation analysis may be significantly reduced, especially with heavyweight DBMSs like PostgreSQL. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",,"Computer software; Relational database systems; Software testing; Taxonomies; Testing, Algorithm design and analysis; Automatic Detection; Equivalent Mutants; Google; Mutation analysis; Relational Database; Relational database management systems; Relational database schemata, Quality control",,,10.1109/TSE.2017.2786286

To evaluate this capability, they can apply code coverage metrics before a software release. However, recent research results have shown that these metrics may not provide a solid basis for this evaluation. Moreover, the fixing of a fault has a cost, and not all faults have the same impact regarding software reliability. In this sense, operational testing aims at assessing parts of the system that are more valuable for users. The goal of this work is to investigate whether traditional code coverage and code coverage merged with operational information can be related to post-release bug detection. We focus on the scope of proprietary software under continuous delivery. We performed an exploratory case study where code branch and statement coverage metrics were collected for each version of a proprietary software together with real usage data of the system. We then measured the ability to explain the bug-fixing activity after version release using code coverage levels. We found that traditional statement coverage has a moderate negative correlation with bug-fixing activities, whereas statement coverage merged with the operational profile has a large negative correlation with higher confidence.

We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of LEMON with 20 release versions of 4 widely-used DL libraries, i.e., TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, MXNet. The results demonstrate that LEMON detected 24 new bugs in the latest release versions of these libraries, where 7 bugs have been confirmed and one bug has been fixed by developers.

Despite interest in studying promising higher-order mutants, such mutants are difficult to find due to the exponential search space of mutation combinations. State-of-the-art approaches rely on genetic search, which is often incomplete and expensive due to its stochastic nature. First, we propose a novel way of finding a complete set of higher-order mutants by using variational execution, a technique that can, in many cases, explore large search spaces completely and often efficiently. Second, we use the identified complete set of higher-order mutants to study their characteristics. Finally, we use the identified characteristics to design and evaluate a new search strategy, independent of variational execution, that is highly effective at finding higher-order mutants even in large codebases.",,"higher-order mutant, mutation analysis, variational execution",,,10.1145/3368089.3409713

However, tests may not detect some faults, limiting feedback, and providing inaccurate grades. This issue can be mitigated by first ensuring that tests can detect faults. Mutation analysis is a technique that generates artificial faulty variants of a program for this purpose, called mutants. Mutants that are not detected by tests reveal their inadequacies, providing knowledge on how they can be improved. By using mutants to improve test suites, tutors can gain the confidence that: a) generated grades will not be biased by unidentified faults, and b) students will receive appropriate feedback for their mistakes. Existing work has shown that mutants are suitable substitutes for faults in real world software, but no work has shown that this holds for students' faults. In this paper, we investigate whether mutants are capable of replicating mistakes made by students. We conducted a quantitative study on 197 Java classes written by students across three introductory programming assignments, and mutants generated from the assignments' model solutions. We found that generated mutants capture the observed faulty behaviour of students' solutions. We also found that mutants better assess test adequacy than code coverage in some cases. Our results indicate that tutors can use mutants to identify and remedy deficiencies in grading test suites.",,"mutation analysis, autograding, introductory programming",,,10.1145/3408877.3432411

While useful in some sense, these types of feedback are akin to revealing the solution to the problem, which can inadvertently encourage students to pursue a trial-and-error approach to testing, rather than using a more systematic approach that encourages learning. In addition to not teaching students why their test suite is inadequate, this type of feedback may motivate students to become dependent on the feedback rather than thinking for themselves. To address this deficiency, there is an opportunity to investigate alternative feedback mechanisms that include a positive reinforcement of testing concepts. We argue that using an inquiry-based learning approach is better than simply providing the answers. To facilitate this type of learning, we present Testing Tutor, a web-based assignment submission platform that supports different levels of testing pedagogy via a customizable feedback engine. We evaluated the impact of the different types of feedback through an empirical study in two sophomore-level courses. We use Testing Tutor to provide students with different types of feedback, either traditional detailed code coverage feedback or inquiry-based learning conceptual feedback, and compare the effects. The results show that students that receive conceptual feedback had higher code coverage (by different measures), fewer redundant test cases, and higher programming grades than the students who receive traditional code coverage feedback.",,"education, testing, pedagogy, tools",,,10.1145/3408877.3432417

Although it is effective at revealing the faults, test suite assessment and its reduction, however, suffer from the expense of executing a large number of mutants. The researchers have proposed different types of cost reduction techniques in the literature. These techniques highly depend on the inspection of mutation operators. Several metrics have been evolved for the same. The selective mutation technique is most frequently used by the researchers. In this paper, the authors investigate different metrics for evaluating the traditional mutation operators for Java. Results on 13 Java programs indicate how grouping few operators can impact the effectiveness of an adequate and minimal test suite, and how this could provide several cost benefits. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",,"Computer software; Cost reduction, Cost benefits; Java program; Mutation operators; Mutation testing; Selective mutation, Java programming language",,,10.1142/S021819402150011X

Recently, code coverage analysis is used as a white-box testing technique for test optimization. Most of the research activities focus on using code coverage for test prioritization and selection within automated testing strategies. Less effort has been paid in the literature to use code coverage for test generation. This paper introduces a new Code Coverage-based Test Case Generation (CCTG) concept that changes the current practices by utilizing the code coverage analysis in the test generation process. CCTG uses the code coverage data to calculate the input parameters’ impact for a constraint solver to automate the generation of effective test suites. We applied this approach to a few real-world case studies. The results showed that the new test generation approach could generate effective test cases and detect new faults. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Application programs; Embedded systems; Formal methods; Logic programming, Automated testing; Constraint solvers; Current practices; Research activities; Test case generation; Test optimization; Test prioritization; White-box testing, Software testing",,,10.1007/978-3-030-67220-1_5
